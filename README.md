Telling Stories With Data Portfolio

# About Me: 

I am a second-year MSPPM. I studied Political Science at Virginia Wesleyan University in Norfolk/Virginia Beach, Virginia. I attended Graduate school directly after my completing my undergraduate degree, however I was also a field organizer on two local state races in Virginia and a field organizer for Clinton's Preisdential Campaign at Ohio State University.  

## What I Hope to Learn 

I am taking this class to learn the basics of presenting data in a coherent way. At CMU we spend a lot of our time talking about how to retrieve data, analyze data, or track data, but very few classes focus specifically on how to present the data in a way that is accessible to the public -- it matters just as much how we say something as what we say. 

### Portfolio 

Hopefully I'll have some cool infographics to go here.
